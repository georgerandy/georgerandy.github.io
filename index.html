        <h3>....Lore....</h3>
        <p>Generations toppled generations, fathers killed sons, sons killed fathers. Comrades fought fiercely and with each battle that occurred,  every weak link had been permanently cut off.
            This was the reality of amphoras, home to the warrior race known as AMPHITURTLEZ.
            
            The amphoras  held pride in their brute strength and built its core value upon the ideology of “survival for the fittest”. It was only honorable of an amphiturtlez to die by battle for no amphitutlez feared death. A parent must train their child to defeat them once of age or die by their hands. 
            
            Every  citizen of amphoraz bore a scar of battle with pride but even among these brute race stood legends, elite class fighters whose opponents never lived to tell the tale. These warriors came to be known as the TROBUL TURTLEZ.
             
            Listen kid im about to tell you a story of how the leader of the Trobul turtlez saved our race from extinction and ended a long cultural line of bloodshed.
            “Leader?”
            Yes turt, he was your father Zelturt
